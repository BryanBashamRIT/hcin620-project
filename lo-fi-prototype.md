# CATA: Lo-Fi Prototypes

This page provides a set of lo-fidelity prototypes for the College Algebra Tutorial App (CATA) project.
These are organized by three general use cases.

## Notes about our Process

The team spent a few days analyzing both the Affinity diagram and our Project scope proposal to determine
the set of web site pages required to satisfy all of the requirements from these two sources.  When then created
a web site map (see next section) that documents these decisions.  Due to time constraints we decided to focus on
the student experience and tabled all of the instructor pages.

Here the student can find his score on the latest quizzes graded.  She was excited to see she had won
a badge for this quiz and she is now on the leaderboard.
