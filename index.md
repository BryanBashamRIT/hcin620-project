# HCIN-720 Project:
# College Algebra Tutor App (CATA)

Project for our HCIN-620 team (term 2195)

## Team Members and Roles

* _Roshni Wadhwa_: UX Design expert
* _Shannon Miller_: Communication and graphic design
* _Edward Wervner_: Writing/Editing and Website design/development
* _Bryan Basham_: Project Management

## Concept
Build a working prototype of a mathematics e-learning platform/tutorial app that specifically covers college (pre-calculus) mathematics disciplines including algebra.

## Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders are the college instructors and their students.  Secondary stakeholders include the HCIN-620 class and the team itself.

## Goals

* The algebra tutorial app will be delivered as a web application accessible both from desktop and mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet
* Construct a working prototype of an established feature set, including a small set of connect learning modules and a separate (timed) quiz module
  * A module may include pre-class learning content
  * Stretch goal: could be a replacement for the textbook; we’ll ask our instructor stakeholders
  * A module will not replace the instructor’s lecture
  * A module will include options for both in-class and post-class (homework) activities
  * A module will include a practice exam that is timed
* Implementation of a reward system to reinforce learning in a positive way (gamification)
  * “Top Student” scoreboard (top three) per module (or by the practice exam?)
  * “Top Student” scoreboard (top three) for the whole class
  * A “badge” for least number of hints needed
  * A “badge” for one or more “top score” achievers?
  * Stretch goal: instructor-reward badges
* The app will include an overview of the course’s module
* The app will include a cross-module navigation system
* The app will include an instructor view page that shows:
* Individual student progress for each module
* Individual student’s scores on activities and practice exams
* A statistical summary of the class’ success (average distribution) with a module

## Concerns

* “Scope creep” with too many requested features and not enough time for production
* Not enough funding provided for app production
* Compromise on feature sets to stay within budget
* Finding/incentivising experienced talent (software engineers/designers/product team)
* There won’t be an opportunity to interview NYS regulators or an appropriate accrediting body so we are eliminating them from the stakeholder list.

## Ideas

* E-learning platform prototype focused on college algebra
* Instructor supplies a list of students for a specific class (aka: course section)
* App must include email and password authentication
* App should promote gamified reward system
* App should include faculty reporting on student’s quiz scores
* App should outline student curriculum in chronological order
* Students are allowed to work ahead of the regular class schedule but instructor controls when module are unlocked
* App should reveal correct answers so students can address mistakes
* App could possibly offer limited hints for questions (and rewards for not using them)
* In-class activities provide immediate feedback
* Homework activities provide feedback after a due-date
* App should provide a class-level “profile” page:
  * Each student is listed with badges
* App should provide a student’s profile page:
  * Visible only to that student and instructor
  * Page includes complete module scores and badges
  * List of completed and up-coming modules
* App should keep track of quiz deadlines set by faculty/administrator
* Should students be permitted to retake quizzes (with randomized question sets)?
* For in-class activities there should be different tiers of question sets (difficulty level) that the app determines based upon the success of previous activities with the same module/lesson
* App could include mock quizzes (where users can reference learning modules) that do not count against GPA
* Learning modules should be locked once quizzes are started
* Unit and practice exams should be timed with progressive and final warnings issued

## Stakeholder Communication

Stakeholders should be continuously informed of development progress. They should intervene if they feel the app’s progression does not with their goals. Stakeholders should be notified when certain features are running behind schedule. Developers should expect extra scope added due to additional/revised designs and features. A prompt feedback system should be implemented so the product owner can be the single point of contact between the stakeholders, the development team and the designers. It should be stressed to the team that the stakeholders represent the clients, and that design changes should be expected and accommodated as development progresses. All client communications should be funneled through the product owner.

## Stakeholder Notification

Stakeholders should be notified regularly via email with a scheduled team demo or web link to the prototype. Feedback should be early and often to prevent the implementation of unwanted features. The design should be communicated as realistically as possible with an incremental progression of addressed stakeholder feedback. Larger features should be broken down into smaller feature sets so that the stakeholders can make important decisions and inform design and development of any changes as soon as possible.

## Application Reengineering

The app should offer the ability to be repurposed to support other schools of STEM education. The app should also integrate with a statewide reporting system where records can be backed up and statistics can be analyzed and applied to curriculum optimization to create and refine learning standards by governmental representatives.
