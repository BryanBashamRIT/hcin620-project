# CATA: Personas

This page details the personas for the College Algebra Tutorial App (CATA) project.

## Primary Persona: _Struggling Student_

The primary user of the CATA system are students that struggle with College Algebra.
The system will be designed to provide enhanced support for students like Mary McClemons

## Persona: _Instructor_

The system must also support the instructors for the College Algebra class but the
features this group of users require are not the primary focus on our project's design
activity.  Natasha Poklonskaya is the ideal person to represent this user community,
specifically because she is an adjunct the system needs to do the dull work of grading
so she can focus on the needs of her students.
