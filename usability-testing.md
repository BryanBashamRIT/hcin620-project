# CATA Usability Testing  Feedback

This page provides the notes from our usabilty testing for the College Algebra Tutorial App (CATA) project.

## App home page
* The user was confused and did not know what tile to click to explore the prototype.
  * *Solution* - Add UI tips for new users.

## Class home page
* Missing signifier in my lessons section that the lessons can be scrolled to see more lessons
* The user was confused about how to use the search bar in my lesson section.
* In the progress section, the percentage should also be included.
  * *Solution* - Add arrows to indicate the lessons can be scrolled. Adding percentages to the progress section

## Leaderboard
* The badges section was confusing at first, too many badges. Not clear what each badge signifies.
  * *Solution* - Add legend for the badges. Tooltip for badges would also be useful.
* Not clear how to go back unless using the top banner menu.
  * *Solution*  - a back button would be useful on the profile and leaderboard pages.

## Quiz page
* User could not locate the quiz page on their own and needed help.
  * *Solution* - place link to quizzes in header navigation so users can take quizzes in advance to get ahead

## Typography
* Elderly user testing the prototype was accustomed to more geriatric websites with bigger font sizes and had trouble reading paragraph text.

## Lesson page
* The user found the content too overwhelming at first.
  * *Solution*: Add spacing between paragraphs to break up content

## Quiz page
* Too much white space on the start quiz page. The start quiz button should have been placed just below the directions as the user has to scroll down to that button.

## Screen resolution
* The user has an older laptop and had to horizontally scroll to view all content on the screen.

## User profile page
* User could not locate the user profile link and needed help.
  * *Solution* - add dropdown menu for user profile and leaderboard
* User had to look at lesson Statistics chart for a bit to clearly distinguish between the sections
  * *Solution* - change the colors to more contrasting options (ie. red for pending, yellow for in progress, and green for completed would be consistent with external systems)
