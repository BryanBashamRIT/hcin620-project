# CATA: Hi-Fi Prototypes

This page provides a describption of hi-fidelity prototype for the College Algebra Tutorial App (CATA) project.
These are organized by three general use cases.

## Notes About Our Process

The team spent a few days analyzing both the Affinity diagram and our Project scope proposal to determine
the set of web site pages required to satisfy all of the requirements from these two sources.  We then created
a web site map (see next section) that captures these decisions.  Due to time constraints we decided to focus on
the student experience and tabled all of the instructor pages.

## Video Script Introduction

This is the video demonstration of the high-fidelity prototype for the project called: College Algebra Tutorial Application;
or CATA for short.  The project team are: Roshni, Shannon, Ed and Bryan.

The CATA project is loosely based upon the MyCourses learning management system but with a focus on create content and
assessments that are designed to teach mathematics concepts and skills.  This video demonstrates three distinct use cases.

The first use case shows:

* _A student views his grades_
* _A student reads a lesson_
* and _A student takes a quiz_

## Use Case 1: Student Views Grades

In the first use case, Andrew wants to view his grades in the _College Algebra_ course.  He start at the Global Home
page and selects the _College Algebra_ course card; the system navigates to the Class Home page for _College Algebra_.
This page provides a Dashboard for this class tuned specifically to this student.  They can view the progress across
all lessons and navgiate to specific lessons that he is working on.  He can also see

Andrew clicks on his profile button to view his class-specific Student Profile page.  He notices that he
has recieved another badge so he navigates to the Leaderboard page to see his status relative to his fellow classmates.

## Use Case 2: Student Takes a Lesson

In the second use case, Andrew wants to get a head start on the next lesson.  He navigates to the _College Algebra_
Class Home page.  There he clicks on the _Zeros of Polynomial Functions_ lesson card.

## Use Case 3: Student Takes a Quiz

In the final use case, Andrew needs to catch up on a previously assigned quiz from lesson one.  He navigates to the
_College Algebra_ Class Home page.  There he clicks on the _Zeros of Polynomial Functions_ lesson card.
