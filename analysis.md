# CATA: Requirements Analysis

This page details the contextual analysis for the CATA project.

## Interviews

We scheduled four interviews with instructors and tutors for Friday, Feb 14th.  Three were successful
and one was a no-show.

| Interviewee | Role | Status
--- | --- | ---
Michelle | Adjunct Instructor | no show
Natalia | Adjunct Instructor | success
Justyna | Tutor | success
Olga | Course Coordinator | success

We attempted to reschedule with Michelle but her schedule wasn't conducive to quick turn-around.
We also reached out to a student tutor but he never returned our emails.

## Personas

We were not able to interview students due to time constraints and negoiations with stakeholders for those interviews.
Therefore, during our interviews with we asked the instructor to describe an over- and an under-achiever student.
We used the following script in this phase of the interview:

> Because they would be the primary user of our fictitious webapp, we need to build personas of them.  Donâ€™t name anyone but if you can think of a specific person that would be ideal.  Think of two distinct individuals: one that excelled and one that struggled.
> 
> * Where is this person from?
> * Why are they taking MATH-101?
> * What are their academic or career goals?
> * A few personality questions:
>   * Introvert or extrovert
>   * Active or passive
>   * Analytical or creative
> * How comfortable are they with MyCourses?  (tech savvy in general?)
> * What are their frustrations?
>   * about the lessons
>   * using MyCourses
