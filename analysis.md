# CATA: Requirements Analysis

This page details the contextual analysis for the CATA project.

## Interviews

We scheduled four interviews with instructors and tutors for Friday, Feb 14th.  Three were successful
and one was a no-show.

| Interviewee | Role | Status
--- | --- | ---
Michelle | Adjunct Instructor | no show
Natalia | Adjunct Instructor | success
Justyna | Tutor | success
Olga | Course Coordinator | success

We attempted to reschedule with Michelle but her schedule wasn't conducive to quick turn-around.
We also reached out to a student tutor but he never returned our emails.
